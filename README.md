# üöÄ transistor-IF-stage

These are two versions of IF-stage for a transistor radio (in my **FLEX-radio project :)**). The two circuits contain TOKO band IF transformers. (Why TOKO? This is a well-know brand in the world of radio, many radio receivers worldwide contain TOKO coils. I also found it in an old pocket radio! ‚ù§Ô∏è)

So, the IF (intermediate frequency) transformer provides the selectivity of this stage in this case. This is a proven solution in radio world, therefore we examine it. I make two versions of this method (only the input side is different), let's see!

## First "traditional" circuit
