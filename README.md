# 🚀 transistor-IF-stage

These are two versions of IF-stage for a transistor radio (in my **FLEX-radio project :)**). The two circuits contain TOKO band IF transformers. (Why TOKO? This is a well-know brand in the world of radio, many radio receivers worldwide contain TOKO coils. I also found it in an old pocket radio! ❤️)

So, the IF (intermediate frequency) transformer provides the selectivity of this stage.
